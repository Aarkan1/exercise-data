Build a fanpage for your favorite genre. It starts small, but has huge possibilities to be a long term project. 

Work solo or in groups. 

### Getting started
Start off by creating a new directory for the exercise. 
Follow up by installing React with React Router Dom in that directory. 

- TypeScript installation
    - npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript
    - npm install react-route-dom@6 @types/react-router-dom
- JavaScript installation
    - npx create-react-app frontend
    - npm install react-route-dom@6

### Basic functionality
- A landing page including:
- Images with titles in a list of cards. Clicking the card or a button should route to a details page.
- A details page with more information. Should fetch data relevant to an id in the url.
- Data should be fetched via an API or importing a JSON-file.

### Advanced functionality
- Add a search input to the landing page to filter data.
- Enable sorting of data on specific properties.
- Add bookmarks/favorites where you can save a character/movie.
- Be able to remove a bookmark/favorite.
- Responsive design that works on both mobile and desktop.
- Persist bookmarks/favorites between page reloads. (localStorage, indexedDB, etc)

### Epic functionality
- Add user registration and authentication to personalize bookmarks/favorites. (only frontend)
- Add a complete REST backend with a database to handle security and fetching data.
